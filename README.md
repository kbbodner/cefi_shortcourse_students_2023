## Overview

Welcome! This repository contains all materials from the Canadian Ecological Forecasting Initiative short course on Forecasting for Decision-Making: An Epidemiological & Ecological Perspective. The course took place at the Fields Institute in Toronto, ON from July 24th - 28th.

In the spirit of having this course be as open as possible, we have put all the course materials here on this GitHub page, including lectures, exercises and forecast modelling materials for three case studies: Infectious Disease Control, Fisheries Management, Water Quality Monitoring. For a description of the course's overall objectives, please see [here](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/23-24/forecasting).

## How to Use This Repository

All code and documentation herein is free to use! If you were unable to make it to the course in person, or simply want to go through this material on your own time, please feel free. This repository is structured into 3 main sections.

### Lectures

First, is the `Lectures` folder, where the various lecture materials can be found for the course. These lectures were recorded, and the recording videos can be found on the CEFI website.
