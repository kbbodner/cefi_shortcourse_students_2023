## Overview

Welcome! This repository contains all materials from the Canadian Ecological Forecasting Initiative short course on Forecasting for Decision-Making: An Epidemiological & Ecological Perspective. The course took place at the Fields Institute in Toronto, ON from July 24th - 28th 2023.

In the spirit of having this course be as open as possible, we have put all the course materials here on this GitHub page, including lectures, exercises and forecast modelling materials for three case studies: Infectious Disease Control, Fisheries Management, Water Quality Monitoring. For a description of the course's overall objectives, please see [here](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/23-24/forecasting).

### Exercises

There are a series of exercises in the `Exercises` folder for you to work through. Instructions are in the `README_EXERCISES.md` file in that directory for how to make use of those. 

There are a number of exercises that span a couple of programming approaches to the current course content. 

### Case Studies

Perhaps most importantly, we have our four case studies. A focal point of this course is having students take a case study of interest, and work on building and expanding a forecast for a focal system. In this iteration of the course there are four case studies, one on fisheries, one on water quality, and two on COVID-19. Each of the COVID-19 case studies are from different locations (Ontario and BC respectively) and take slightly different approaches. 

There are extensive documentation for each of the case studies in their respective folders, along with troubleshooting tips. Please take the time to read through each case study before starting, as each of them have slightly different software requirements.
